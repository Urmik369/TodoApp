Notes:
- Do NOT include `bin/`, `obj/` or the SQLite `todo.db` in the repository. They're already excluded by `.gitignore`.
- If you prefer a smaller repo, you can remove the full `wwwroot/lib` folder and restore client libs with a package manager (LibMan/npm) or CDN links instead.
- If you plan to publish to GitHub, consider squashing the initial large commits or creating a fresh repo from the current working tree (we already removed runtime artifacts from tracking).
